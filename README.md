Welcome to Tennis Courts in San Francisco!
This application will help you find tennis court, club and shop locations in SF

By clicking on the tabs at the bottom of the screen you can pick which kind of
tennis sort you want

You can also style the map like any of the major tennis tournaments by choosing
a style at the very bottom of the screen.

On the left hand side you can refine your search to one specific court/facility

By clicking on a point you can get more information such as lighting or
phone number in the case of a tennis club or facility.

If you have any questions about the app feel free to click the About the Author

Best,
Alex
